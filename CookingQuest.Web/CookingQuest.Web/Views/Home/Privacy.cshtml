    According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wingsare too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anywaybecause bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast isready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this ishappening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid goodmoney for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. Aperfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in thehouse! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Neverthought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward.Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did comeback different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? -Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, youdie. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of theway. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't needvacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we aremen. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, pleasewelcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. Thatconcludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjobtoday? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, adivision of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know thatyou, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for yourwhole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured intothis soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl washot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, weconstantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing anew helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have ourlatest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honeythat hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course.Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The samejob the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to knowthat bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us todeath? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you saythat? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we onlyhave to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Whywould you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society onEarth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me oneexample. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. RoyalNectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! -Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, butsome don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You'resky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned.Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to bea Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I willsee in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you'rewearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It mustbe dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! Hehad a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thoughtI'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I canautograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hittinga sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us,


    but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate.What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well,there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same jobevery day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move itaround, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know,Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinkingof what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son'snot sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to befunny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be astirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything rightnow. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll piercemy thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and calleverybody \"dawg\"! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! Allthe good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk,hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes,sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh,my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chanceof getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey'salways open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes anopening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead fromthe neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stuntbee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mitewrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflowerpatch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out?Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You'regonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's aKorean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid wesaw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got arain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always,watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reportsof root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! -That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking tohumans! All right, launch positions!

Bring it around30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It'sgot a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pickup some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power.More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot ofbright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of theseflowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative.That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. Itsmells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a littlegrabby.

More humans. I don't need this. What was that?Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It'sfantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one?Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believewhat I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergicto them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does hislife have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value.You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm notscared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face couldpuff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right.Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. -You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta saysomething. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would Isay? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. Ican't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.How should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi!I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'mdreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit ofa surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but theywere all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee istalking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to dothat? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick itup. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we haveto deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... Idon't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's justcoffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you wantrum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couplemicrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you knowanything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flyingup Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.And he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry awatermelon?\" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what areyou gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can'tdo it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to bea lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Ournew queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There'smy hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way!I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?- It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah.Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...?Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well,then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... forbefore. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work.He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It wasamazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you werewith humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of


    them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. Yousaw whatever you wanted to see. You had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjoband be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?!Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. Iknow it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she?She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa.- Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're notdating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with powerwashers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understandsme. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was sostingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You knowwhat a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sitdown! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes,but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen tome! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You knowwhat your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It'sbeen three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make alittle honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry,I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be toolong. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respondto yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I'vegotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide?Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded byflowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. Allright, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you runeverywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze liveTV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horribledisease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It'susually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take awalk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy,lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's notbothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much ourlimit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. Whatin the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, RayLiotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people.We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Beesmake it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. Youneed a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?!Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting tothe bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, Iguess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted,box boy!

Like tinyscreaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as faras the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. Imean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Notus, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You amosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! Atleast you're out in the world.

Twice the nicotine,all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and wemake the money. \"They make the honey, and we make the money\"? Oh, my! What's goingon? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fakewalls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man inwomen's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Beehoney. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anythingbears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are takingour honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These areobviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. -What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry!We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket oncein San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do withyour life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I rememberyou coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I rememberthat. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lipbalm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where itreally hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There'sonly one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive'sonly full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi.

A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue thehuman race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrownight on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing theirnew book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.Did you ever think, \"I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this\"? Bees have never been afraid tochange the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'dnever sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The beecommunity is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know,they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He lookslike you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes onthe bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They'rescary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. Intennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, herbackhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work goingon here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. -Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, Ibelieve. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. Butit's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two havebeen at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How manysugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have


    good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are givingballoon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those justget me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate thosefake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make upfor it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through withit? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where theworld anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if ahoneybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? Ican't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollarmultinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind thebarricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team.You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oasenumber 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now insession. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? Aprivilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, YourHonor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladiesand gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, shebelieved it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. Ifwe lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. Iwould have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How dowe know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? Theycould be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could beon steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinarybee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it.And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who thinkthey can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'llsee how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! Iwish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. KlaussVanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also ownHoneyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find thatto be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - Icouldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, itseems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're verylovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees!How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spittingout your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for beinghere. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called ThePolice. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. Andso here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothingmore than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not hisreal name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guestspot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishlyhandsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don'thave to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and wecan all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr.Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think thejury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to agreat team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, Iwas just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I calledBarry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah,heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the gamemyself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking


    at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We havethat in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking thecrud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for hisfuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look atthat. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - ItalianVogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why isyour life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think somethingstinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much.Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues!Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl isgnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don'teven like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to bethe nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are thereother bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one ofthem! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotionalroller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificialsweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! Ialways felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh,well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would liketo call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's consideredone of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it'sgonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remindthem of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only tolosing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. Whatexactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good?Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a beedocumentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the beechildren? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Holdme back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'alldate your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what hewants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursingthrough my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can'ttreat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's theirway! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward tosuck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order,please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against thebees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. -Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. Whatmatters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got itfrom the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. Whatwas it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and thenecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. Whatwere we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humansdo to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound sobad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to closethat window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don'tsmoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed.I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. Andassuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, YourHonor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to flyhaphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny storyabout... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuabletime? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They havepresented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who runlegitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm


    afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have aterrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it,Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a beesmoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\" Is thiswhat nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-madewooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What arewe gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free thesebees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The courtfinds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK!You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't haveto work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who areyou wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right?- What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand acomplete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours tobegin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anythingmore than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in thewoods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stagename! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr.Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need toshut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop makinghoney! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production!Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn'tbelieve how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? -Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleepingin. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got ourhoney back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's thegreatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. Thiswas my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand whythey're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing.Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What didyou want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my.They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is?You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing tomake honey would affect all these things. It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all needbees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animalkingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there's no more pollination, it couldall just go south here, couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact?How do we do it? - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen,Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa?Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade inPasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the lastchance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn outlike this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses.Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers, bees,pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made itworse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But Ihave another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it!All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flowerbud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. -


    Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses,Pasadena, Oalifornia. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security willbe tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am.Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about ThePrincess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. -Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea? It goes under themattresses. - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal. You do that! Thiswhole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then allwe do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport, there's nostopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it been in yourpossession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - It's part ofme. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enoughpollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to dothe job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up there and talkto them. Be careful. Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talkinginflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, I'm in a real situation. - What'd you say, Hal? -Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! I'man attorney! - Who's an attorney? Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This isyour captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And pleasehurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One'sbald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one'sflying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome.I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot. Notgood. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - Who'sthat? - Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than abig metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. - Why not? Isn't JohnTravolta a pilot? - Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspensefulscene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory... That's Barry! ...is attempting toland a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers?! Wehave a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flightexperience. Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane. I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson andhis no-account compadres. They've done enough damage. But isn't he your only hope?Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven't we heardthis a million times? \"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\" - Get thison the air! - Got it. - Stand by. - We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you.Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a smalljob. If you do it well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone.That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not madeof Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover. - Hover?- Forget hover. This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, Ithink we were on autopilot the whole time. - That may have been helping me. - And nowwe're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move itout! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of theplane! Don't have to yell. I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble. It's very hard to concentratewith that panicky tone in your voice! It's not a tone. I'm panicking! I can't do this! Vanessa,pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it. You snap out of it. - Yousnap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!- You snap out of it! - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn. How is the plane flying? I don'tknow. Hello? Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! Theydo get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow. - Hello. All right, let's drop this tin can on theblacktop. Where? I can't see anything. Oan you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Oome on. Yougot to think bee, Barry. - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinkingbee! Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.


    Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose down. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinkingbee! - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that! Thinking bee! Thinkingbee! Thinking bee! - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK. Out the engines. We're going in onbee power. Ready, boys? Affirmative! Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it. Land on that flower!Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one? - Thatflower. - I'm aiming at the flower! That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giantpulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. Rotate around it. -This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is thisplane flying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Fullreverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!Oome on, already. Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! - Yes. No high-five! - Right. Barry,it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw theflower! That was genius! - Thank you. - But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway iscovered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That meansthis is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress likethis. If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say? Are we goingto be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains? We're bees! Keychain! Then followme! Except Keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. Yeah! I'm a Pollen Jock! Andit's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That's our Barry. Mom! The bees areback! If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working latetonight! Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next? Would you likesome honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea. Barry, I'msorry. Have you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.Sorry I'm late. He's a lawyer too? I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was abriefcase. Have a great afternoon! Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get themanywhere. No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me. You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who'snext? All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly. Thank you, Barry! That bee is living my life! Let itgo, Kenny. - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go. - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office. You have got to start thinking bee,my friend. - Thinking bee! - Me? Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,everyone. Oan we stop here? I'm not making a major life decision during a productionnumber! All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys. I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
